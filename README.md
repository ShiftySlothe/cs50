# CS50 - An Introduction to Computer Science
## Charles Forson, Completed 2021

Within each branch contains the completed code for each assignment for CS50 - Harvards Introduction to Computer Science.
CS50 is a 12 week, 120 hour, assessed course offered by Harvard University. 
CS50 presented a fantastic oppurtunity for me to gain an understanding of core fundamentals which massively accelerated my learning. 

### Topics covered 

1) Fundamental data structures
2) Algorithmic thinking & recursion
3) Memory 
4) Web programming fundamentals
5) Flask

### Proudest moment

As part of the data structures module, we we're challenged to construct a spell checker in C and assessed on it's performance against the faculty. I spent hours considering the fastest approach and was eventually able to beat the faculty's time. You can review the code in pset 5 - Speller.
